Diverse publications (from Public domain to CC)

This publication was created for a client and paid for by public funding. 

While the tender required for a smaller amount of material, given our workload allowed for it (and the client was genuinly nice to work with), we spent extra time and effort to create this deliverable.

As it is funded by public money, in order for this material to be able to circulate, be re-used and adapted by anyone, we have made the conscious decision to publish it under PUBLIC DOMAIN licence, this includes all the illustrations and pictures in it as well. We do strongly believe that any material is only as good as it is distributed and used.

You may use this material in any way you wish, including commercially. 

While not requested, we would appreciate if when you use it you would give us credit for it. 

Have fun.
